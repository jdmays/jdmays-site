              I'm not your typical engineer. In fact, I'll tell you a secret.
              I'm not an engineer at all. At least not in the way you might be
              thinking. I'm a problem solver. I'm a creator. I'm a builder. I
              love it when a plan comes together.

              Let's go back in time. Back to the halcyon days of the late 70s.

              In my Algebra class, there was a section set aside for some
              computers. I was able to just hack away to my delight. No, that's
              not true. Actually, we weren't allowed to touch the computers.
              Those were for people in advanced math classes and I was
              definitely not in an advanced math class.
            </p>

            <p className="text-md text-gray-600 my-2">
              At that time, I had a good friend who loved computers. His
              aspiration was to go work for Apple Computer. (He did and Macs are
              still a big part of his consulting business.) As for me, I thought
              computers would never be that big of a deal. Fine for some niche
              areas but not for most normal people. However, what I really
              enjoyed was Philosophy and what I thought of as Applied Philosophy
              but most know it as Psychology.

              When people give career advice they usually say something like,
              "Find your passion and follow that. If you love what you do you'll
              never work a day in your life." That kind of advice is fine if
              there is anything that you're passionate about. What if you are
              pretty indifferent to most things and just want to do something
              that isn't too horribly unpleasant? That was me. The career advice
              I gave to myself and give to others today is this: Most people
              don't know what they want to do, yet they do know what they hate
              doing. Just steer away from what you hate doing and eventually
              you'll find something you like.

              The thing about Psychology, especially when it comes down to
              applying it to real live people, is that it's a system or a
              constellation of things. There is never just one thing. I love
              systems. I think about them a lot; whether it is groups of people,
              organizations, or a computer system.

              Which brings me back to being a software developer. Code doesn't
              exist in isolation. It's a whole bunch of things working together.
              It involves pulling things together and making them work together,
              much like a story.
