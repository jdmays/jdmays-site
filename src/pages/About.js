            I'm a web application developer that really enjoys Making The Magic.
            I've been developing web applications since the days of Perl CGI
            scripts and I've worked with a variety of technologies over the years,
            but I'm always looking for new challenges.

            If you take a good look at my experience and eduction, you'll notice
            there are two careers buried in there. For the first twenty years or
            so I was a Mental Health Counselor and then a healthcare executive.
            I was always interested in Information Technology and during that
            time I was also writing programs and scripts to make my job easier.
          </p>

            One of the threads that ties it all together is; I'm a creative
            problem-solver, I love to build things and I absolutely love it when
            a plan comes together.
          </p>

            Switching careers takes a lot of work. In order to do it
            successfully you have to be willing to learn. You have to be willing
            to listen and you have to like taking on new challenges.
