## Acknowledgements

You should never start a project without seeing if someone else has done it first, and then, if they have, you should copy them.  
Of course, you shouldn't copy them verbatim, but you should see how they are doing things make it your own.

I started with the excellent work of [Michael D'Angelo] (https://mldangelo.com/).  He was kind enough to make his git repo publicly 
available, and I was able to use it as a starting point for my own site.  

I simplified things a bit and changed a lot. But the biggest thing I grabbed from his site is his honesty.  I loved the tone he set and 
it gave me courage to be forthright about who I am.  

I am nowhere near as impressive as he is, yet I hope to be impressive in my own way.  Thanks Michael for the inspiration.

## Under Construction

As of June 21, 2024, I'm still working on this thing. I'm going to change the resume a bit and take a really good look to ensure that 
I didn't make any dumb errors or typos. 

I will also be adding some projects to my git repository to demonstrate some expertise with React, Javascript, Laravel, and Vue.
