## Details

This website was written with React and Tailwind.  I chose Tailwind because it uses conventions that a great many CSS 
frameworks use and it's pretty intuitive.  I've worked a lot with Bootstrap and wanted to demonstrate that not every single thing needs to be done with it. 

One of the downsides of Tailwind is that unless you add custom styles, there is a lot of repetitive markup. 
If you are adding custom styles then you might as well just use regular CSS since you aren't saving yourself any work. However, 
since this is a pretty small project it seemed like Tailwind was the right approach.

I used React to be able to demonstrate that I know how to use React.  This, at least, demonstrates some basic knowledge of the framework.

I broke things up into different sections to make it cleaner but I didn't break it up as much as I could have.  To me, there is a 
certain balance necessary when segmenting things. With this being a very small application and I'm the only one who will every work on it so there wasn't much need to be overly strict.


## Acknowledgements

The first thing I did when I decided to update the website was look at what others have done.  I found an excellent site by [Michael D'Angelo] (https://mldangelo.com/). 
I like the fact that the website is not cluttered and he injects a lot of his personality into it.  Of course, I simplified a few things 
because I didn't think they were necessary and most importantly, his content gave me a certain amount of courage to just be myself.
